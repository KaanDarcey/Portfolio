                    My name is Kaan Darcey and I'm a Front-End Developer & UI/UX Designer based in Vancouver. <br/><br/>

Iâ€™m about to graduate from my diploma of digital design and development at BCIT (with distinctions).
I love problem solving and helping people achieve their goals. I'm passionate about my work and have a strong desire to always be growing and learning.<br/><br/>

I have made web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have experience in making mobile applications using React Native, PHP, and MySQL for android and IOS. Additionally I am currently working on a project using React.js and SASS.<br/><br/>

I have also worked through the design process which involved User Research (including user surveys, identifying target demographics, user personas, and task models), creating Low-Fidelity Prototypes/Wireframes (using InVision and Balsamiq), creating Mock Ups (using Sketch and Figma), creating High-Fidelity Prototypes (with InVision), and User Testing.
